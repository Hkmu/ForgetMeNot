How to help translate the app
=============================

There are 2 ways to translate the app:

**1. Standard way**

Take the original [strings.xml](/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) file, translate into your language and send the translated version to my email: odnovolov.artem@gmail.com. You may additionally find [the article about strings](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource) useful. As an example, I provide my translations:
* [strings.xml](/app/src/main/res/values-uk/strings.xml) (Ukrainian)
* [strings.xml](/app/src/main/res/values-ru/strings.xml) (Russian)


**2. Using the service Crowdin (recommended)**

Visit [the ForgetMeNot project page on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/forgetmenot), select the language, select the file 'strings.xml'. You will come to edit mode. The advantage of this approach:
* user-friendly interface
* there are many strings accompanied with screenshots
* machine translation suggestions to help you complete the translation in one click
* you may translate not all at once
* provide up-to-date translations along with app evolution
